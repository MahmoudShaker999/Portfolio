<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
I am a Computer Science student with a solid foundation in programming and
problem solving. I have studied core topics such as algorithms, data
structures, object-oriented programming, and databases.
</p>
<p>
I enjoy building small to medium-sized projects that help me understand how
software systems work in practice, especially web applications using Python.
